## Introduction

Lua is a lightweight, high-level programming language designed primarily for embedding within applications as a scripting language. It provides a simple and efficient syntax, a powerful set of features, and a small footprint, making it ideal for a wide range of applications and platforms. This readme serves as a quick guide to get you started with Lua programming.

## Installation

To use Lua, you need to install the Lua interpreter, which is available for various platforms including Windows, macOS, and Linux. Here are the installation steps:

1. Visit the official Lua website: [www.lua.org](http://www.lua.org)
2. Navigate to the "Download" section.
3. Choose the appropriate version for your platform and download the installation package.
4. Follow the installation instructions specific to your operating system.

Once the installation is complete, you can verify the installation by opening a command prompt or terminal and typing `lua -v`. You should see the Lua version number if the installation was successful.

## Getting Started

To start writing Lua programs, all you need is a text editor. You can use any text editor of your choice, such as Notepad++, Sublime Text, or Visual Studio Code.

Here's a simple "Hello, World!" program in Lua:

```lua
print("Hello, World!")

Save the above code into a file with the .lua extension, such as hello.lua. You can then run the Lua script by executing the following command in the terminal:
```bush
lua hello.lua
```
You should see the output Hello, World! printed in the console.

## Language Basics
Lua has a concise and expressive syntax. Here are a few fundamental concepts to help you get started:

Variables and Types
Lua is dynamically typed, which means you don't need to explicitly declare variable types. Variable names start with a letter or underscore and can contain letters, digits, and underscores. Lua supports the following basic data types:

`nil`: Represents the absence of a value.
`boolean`: Represents true or false.
`number`: Represents numerical values (floating-point by default).
`string`: Represents a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes.
`table`: Represents a collection of key-value pairs.
`function`: Represents a block of reusable code.

## Control Structures
Lua provides standard control structures, including conditional statements and loops:

`if statement`: Allows conditional execution based on a condition.
`for loop`: Iterates over a range of values.
`while loop`: Executes a block of code while a condition is true.
`repeat...until loop`: Executes a block of code until a condition is true.
## Functions
Functions in Lua are first-class citizens, meaning they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned as values. Here's an example of a function definition:
function greet(name)
```lua
    print("Hello, " .. name .. "!")
end

greet("Alice") -- Output: Hello, Alice!
```
## Modules
Lua allows you to organize code into reusable modules. A module is a collection of functions and variables that can be loaded and used in other Lua scripts. Here's an example of a module definition:
```lua
-- module.lua
local module = {}

function module.sayHello()
    print("Hello from the module!")
end

return module
```
To use the module in another script:
```lua
local myModule = require("module")
myModule.sayHello() -- Output: Hello from the module!
```
## Resources
Lua has extensive documentation and a supportive community. Here are some resources to help you learn more:
